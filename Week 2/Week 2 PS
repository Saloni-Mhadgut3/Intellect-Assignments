Problem Statement:

Extend the Bank Account class (created in the last assignment) to create a subclass Savings Account with an additional feature of calculating interest. 
Implement a method calculate Interest() to calculate interest on the current balance using a fixed interest rate (e.g., 3%). 
Make sure to invoke the parent class constructor using the super keyword in this child class constructor.

Sample Test Cases:

SavingsAccount savingsAccount = new SavingsAccount("1234567890", "Jane Smith");
savingsAccount.deposit(1000);
savingsAccount.calculateInterest();
System.out.println(savingsAccount.getBalance()); // Expected output: 1030.0

Explanation:

Create a subclass Savings Account that inherits from Bank Account.
Add a method calculate Interest() to calculate interest and update the balance accordingly based on a fixed interest rate.

P.S:
Make sure to follow the proper naming conventions and abide by the question. (It is observed that many of you havenâ€™t followed in the last assignment.) 
Submit the solution consisting of the Bank Account class & Savings Account class.
