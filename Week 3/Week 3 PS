Problem Statement:

Extend the BankAccount class to include different types of accounts such as CurrentAccount and SavingsAccount. 
Implement a method calculateInterest() for SavingsAccount and a method deductPenalty() for CurrentAccount. 
Ensure proper overriding of methods for each account type.

Sample Test Cases:
BankAccount currentAccount = new CurrentAccount("1234567890", "John Doe");
currentAccount.deposit(1000);
((CurrentAccount) currentAccount).deductPenalty();  // PENALTY_AMOUNT = 10.0 (constant)
System.out.println(currentAccount.getBalance()); // Expected output: 990.0

Explanation:
Create subclasses CurrentAccount and SavingsAccount that inherit from BankAccount.
Override methods calculateInterest() in SavingsAccount to calculate interest and deductPenalty() in CurrentAccount to deduct a penalty.

P.S:
Make sure to follow the proper naming conventions and abide by the instructions only what is mentioned in the question. 
Submit the solution consisting of the BankAccount class, CurrentAccount class & SavingsAccount class.
