Week 1: Class & Object Concepts


Problem Statement:
Create a Java class named BankAccount to represent a basic bank account. It should
have private instance variables for account number (String), account holder
name (String), balance (double), and public methods to deposit, withdraw, and
display balance (use getter).

Implement the appropriate constructor implementation and the default value of balance is 0.0.


Sample Test Case:BankAccount account = new BankAccount("1234567890", "John Doe");

account.deposit(1000);
account.withdraw(500);

System.out.println(account.getBalance());
// Expected output: 500.0

System.out.println("Insufficient funds"); // If incase of excess
withdrawal


Explanation:

Create a class BankAccount with instance variables accountNumber, accountHolderName, and balance.
Implement methods, void deposit(double amount) and void withdraw(double amount) to modify the balance accordingly.
Provide a method getBalance() to retrieve the current balance.
